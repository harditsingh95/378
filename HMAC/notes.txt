Eliminate options
getcwd
create keys at keys/rsa (generate function RSAkeyGenfor this)
don't need kPath kName because should be constant, maybe for fileName
listdir in current directory
for each fileName in listdir, run RSAEncryptMAC, passing fileName, constant path.pem
- don't prompt for file name in jsonpack or mydecrypt
jsonpacks should contain fileName, grabbed from listdir
should be it

remove decrypt option
